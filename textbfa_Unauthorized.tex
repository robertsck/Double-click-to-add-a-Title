\textbf{(a) Unauthorized Access/Misuse of the Device Itself}

These cases create the greatest risk due to their safety impacts.
Examples of such attacks include:

• Insulin Pumps - A participant at an NTIA IOT security conference
described how he was able to hack into an insulin pump and adjust the
device so that it no longer delivered medicine\footnote{See note 1.}.
Researcher was Jay Radcliffe - Yahoo article provides further
details\footnote{JORDAN ROBERTSON, ``Insulin Pumps, Monitors Vulnerable
  to Hacking,'' \emph{Yahoo News}, August 5, 2011.}

• Another NTIA participant discussed being able to remotely gain access
to a car's internal computer network\footnote{See note 1.}.

• In 2012, the FBI released a security alert detailing the manipulation
of smart meters in order to reduce electricity charges\footnote{http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/fbi-smart-meter-hacks-likely-to-spread/}.
