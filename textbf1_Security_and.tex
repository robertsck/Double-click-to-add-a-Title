\textbf{1. Security and Privacy Risks}

The increased security and privacy risks posed by the IoT is a topic
have been receiving significant attention both by the government and the
media. A recent RFC and workshop held by the NTIA discussed many of the
risks posed to consumers (some of which are highlighted below)\footnote{N
  Hall, ``The Kardashian Index: A Measure of Discrepant Social Media
  Profile for Scientists.,'' \emph{Genome Biol} 15, no. 7 (2014): 424.}.
The Department of Homeland Security has also documented the risks of a
cyber-attack against internet-enabled critical infrastructure\footnote{Department
  of Homeland Security DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, Office of Cyber
  and Infrastructure Analysis, ``The Future of Smart Cities:
  Cyber-Physical Infrastructure Risk,''.}.

These risks are not just theoretical, many attacks against devies have
been demonstrated and every day brings new newspaper and blog articles
detailing actual attacks. In general, risks against IoT can placed into
three categories:

• Unauthorized acces to and misuse of the device itself.

• Unauthorized access to and misuse of the data collected by such
devices.

• Use of the device to attack other devices.
